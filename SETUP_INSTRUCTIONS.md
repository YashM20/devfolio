## 📝 Required Setup

### 1. Get Google Gemini API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Get API Key"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"Create API Key"** 
5. Copy the generated API key

### 2. Set Environment Variable

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# In your project root directory
touch .env.local
```

Add your API key to `.env.local`:

```env
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with the actual API key you copied from Google AI Studio.

### 3. Restart Development Server

After adding the environment variable, restart your dev server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
pnpm dev
```

## 🎯 How to Test

1. **Look for the button**: You should see a floating sparkles button in the **bottom center** of your screen
2. **Click to open**: Click the button to open the glassmorphism chat modal
3. **Test the chat**: Try asking questions like:
   - "What projects has Yash worked on?"
   - "Tell me about your React experience"
   - "What technologies do you use?"
   - "Do you have experience with mobile development?"

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+K** (or Cmd+K on Mac): Open chat anywhere on the site
- **Escape**: Close the chat modal
- **Enter**: Send message (when input is focused)

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Bottom Center Positioning**: Button positioned in center bottom
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Beautiful glass-like transparency effect
- **Smooth Animations**: Physics-based animations with Framer Motion
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with dismiss buttons
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "API key is not configured" error
**Solution**: Make sure you've created `.env.local` with the correct API key and restarted the dev server.

### Issue: Chat button doesn't appear
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. The button appears with a 1-second delay.

### Issue: Input not working
**Solution**: Ensure the API key is valid and you have internet connection.

### Issue: Responses are slow
**Solution**: This is normal for Gemini API. The responses stream in real-time.
