I'm Yash, a software engineer from India, and I've been stuck in portfolio purgatory for way too long.

You know that feeling when you start building something, get 80% done, then suddenly hate everything about it? Yeah, that was me for the past few years. Four or five different versions, each time convinced _this_ would be the one. Spoiler alert: it never was.

## The Breakthrough

Then I stumbled across [Chánh Đại's portfolio](https://chanhdai.com/blog/welcome) (@iamncdai) and something clicked. Clean design, thoughtful structure, actually useful instead of just pretty. Instead of starting from scratch again like some masochistic developer, I did something revolutionary—I used what already worked.

But here's where it gets interesting. I didn't just clone it and call it a day. I started with integrated something I've been experimenting with: an AI chat assistant powered by the Next.js AI SDK V5. Want to know about my experience with React? Ask the AI. Curious about that weird side project I built last year? The AI knows. It's like having a personal assistant that actually knows what they're talking about.

## What This Place Is

This isn't just another portfolio site collecting digital dust. It's my central hub for everything I'm working on, thinking about, or building. The components I'm tinkering with, the tools I'm discovering, the random thoughts that hit me at 2 AM while debugging—it all lives here.

The AI isn't just a gimmick either. I trained it on my actual experience, projects, and tech stack. It can dive deep into specific implementations or give you the high-level overview of what I do. Way more efficient than making you dig through static pages.

## The Technical Bits

Built on Next.js 15 with Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui components. The AI integration uses the latest SDK patterns, and everything's optimized for both performance and developer experience. Because what's the point of building something if it's slow or painful to maintain?

## What's Coming

I'm planning to document more of my experiments here—both the successes and the spectacular failures. The component library I'm building, the AI tools I'm exploring, maybe even some thoughts on the state of software development (it's complicated).

This portfolio will continue to evolve as I grow as a developer. I plan to:

- Add more interactive components and demos
- Share insights from projects I'm working on
- Experiment with new technologies and document the journey
- Continuously improve the AI chat experience

More content, more experiments, more honest takes on what it's really like building software.

Thank you for visiting, and feel free to explore! If you have any questions about my work or experience, don't hesitate to try out the AI chat - it's there to help.
